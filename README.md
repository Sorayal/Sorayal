### Hello and welcome, dear visitor ðŸ‘‹.

Thank you for looking in. I am a junior developer since 2021 after I switched my career. 
At my current job as backend developer I am working mainly with Java and Spring Boot.
Here is mainly my collection of some practice projects. Feel free to look around here.

## Some Topics
- [Small Java Projects](https://github.com/Sorayal/Java_Small_Projects)
- [Small Python Projects](https://github.com/Sorayal/Python_Small_Projects)
- [C#](https://github.com/Sorayal/CSharp)

## Skill Matrix (5 levels)

Explanation:
1. Superficial knowledge, first practical application
2. Some basic concepts known, occasional practical use
3. Basic knowledge available, regular practical use
4. Advanced knowledge in theory and practice
5. Expert knowledge in theory and practice, capable of teaching it.

Please be aware, itÂ´s a subjective matrix. Also because technologies and tools  
can change very much over the time, some skills might drop again. One example would
be C Sharp which I used regulary in the past. DotNet evolved alot, also the language  
in many ways. So I am not update to date there anymore and not aware about new features  
and standards to write modern code.
