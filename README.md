### Hello and welcome, dear visitor ðŸ‘‹.

Thank you for looking in. I have been a junior developer since 2021 after I switched my career.  
At my current job as a software developer, I am working mainly with Java and Spring Boot.  
Here is mainly my collection of some practice projects. Feel free to look around here  
and have a good day.

## Some Topics

- [Small Python Projects](https://github.com/Sorayal/Python_Small_Projects)

## Skill Matrix (5 levels)

Explanation:
1. Superficial knowledge, first practical application
2. Some basic concepts are known, and occasional practical use
3. Basic knowledge available, regular practical use
4. Advanced knowledge in theory and practice
5. Expert knowledge in theory and practice, capable of teaching it.

Please be aware, itÂ´s a subjective matrix. Also because technologies and tools  
can change very much over time, some skills might drop again. One example  
would be C Sharp which I used regularly in the past. DotNet evolved a lot, also  
a language in many ways. So I am not up to date there anymore and not  
aware of new features and standards to write modern code.
