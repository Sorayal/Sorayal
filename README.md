### Hello and welcome, dear visitor ðŸ‘‹.

Thank you for looking in. I have been a junior developer since 2021 after I switched my career.  
At my current job as a software developer, I am working mainly with Java and Spring Boot.  
Here is mainly my collection of some practice projects. Feel free to look around here  
and have a good day.
